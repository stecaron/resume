\cvsection{Projects}
\cvproject{Anomaly detection using the encoded representation of variational autoencoders (VAE) \href{https://github.com/stecaron/deep-stat-thesis/blob/master/rapports/main-memoire.pdf}{\faGithubSquare}}
\begin{itemize}
\item In my master degree thesis, I used the encoded representation of a VAE to detect abnormal images from a dataset. I also did compared this approach with traditionnal anomaly detection methods applied on images.
\end{itemize}

\cvproject{Semantic segmentation on hockey broadcasts images \href{https://github.com/stecaron/glo-7030-projet/blob/master/pancarte/main-pancarte.pdf}{\faGithubSquare}}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this school team project, we designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of learning the semantic of hockey broadcast images. We annotated the images using polygons, and then trained a U-Net artchitecture to predict a class (red line, blue line, ice, crowd, etc) for every pixel. We also presented this project at 2019 Ottawa Hockey Analytics Conference poster session.

\cvproject{Big Data Cup 2021: Ottawa Hockey Analytics Conference \href{https://github.com/dot-layer/bigdatacup-2021/blob/main/report/CaronLeCavalierPerreault-BigDataCup2021.pdf}{\faGithubSquare}}
\begin{itemize}
\item During this competition, we proposed an analysis on the impact of winning offensive zone faceoffs during a hockey game. We participated in the "Open" category.
\end{itemize}

\cvproject{\textit{.Layer} blog website \href{https://www.dotlayer.org/en/}{\faGlobe}}
\begin{itemize}
\item I contributed to the building of the NPO blog website using Hugo framework. I also contributed by writting multiple posts and reviewing others.
\end{itemize}
